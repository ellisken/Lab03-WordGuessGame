# Lab03-WordGuessGame
C# console app that allows a user to guess the letters of a mystery word. Users also have the following options: see all possible words, add a word, delete a word.

This program was written for Code Fellows Code 401 C#/.NET class to practice exception handling. It purposefully excludes the use of classes.

## Installation/Usage

During game play, you will be prompted to enter in letter guesses until you've guessed the whole word.
