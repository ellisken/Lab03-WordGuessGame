# Lab03-WordGuessGame
C# console app that allows a user to guess the letters of a mystery word. Users also have the following options: see all possible words, add a word, delete a word.

This program was written for Code Fellows Code 401 C#/.NET class to practice exception handling. It purposefully excludes the use of classes.

## Installation/Usage
Clone the repository, open the WordGuessGame solution in Visual Studio, and run without debugging. Select options from the menu to play (1), see words (2), add word (3), delete word (4), or exit (5). During game play, you will be prompted to enter in letter guesses until you've guessed the whole word.
